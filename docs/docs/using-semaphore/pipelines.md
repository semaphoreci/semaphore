A pipeline is a group of connected blocks. This page explains what pipelines are, how they organize workflow execution order, and what settings are available.

## Overview {#overview}

The purpose of a pipeline is to connect blocks using dependencies. This lets you plan the execution order.

Pipelines are also the *unit of configuration*. Each pipeline is encoded as separate a YAML file in the `.semaphore` folder. 

For reference, here is an example pipeline with its respective YAML.

```

## Workflow execution order {#dependencies}

In the same way that a block is a group of [jobs](./jobs), a pipeline is a group of blocks. Pipelines connect blocks using dependencies. Semaphore derives the execution order from these dependencies.

Take the following example:

- Blocks B and C depend on Block A
- Block D depends on both Blocks B and C

In this scenario, Block B and C wait until Block A is done. Block D in turn, waits for Blocks B and C to be finished.

![Pipeline execution order](./img/pipeline-execution-order.jpg)

You can reorder blocks by changing their dependencies using the visual editor.

<VideoTutorial title="How to reorder blocks" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6o8gssc5JIQ?si=el9coKJyPzMXpKTq" opened={true} />

<details>
 <summary>What if we removed all dependencies?</summary>
 <div>If we removed dependencies between blocks, then all of them would run in parallel. 
 Functionally, it would be the same as having all jobs in one big block</div>
</details>

## Pipeline initialization {#init}

Before Semaphore can start running the jobs in the pipeline, the pipeline YAML file needs to be parsed from the repository. As a first step, Semaphore retrieves the file using the GitHub or BitBucket API and inspects its contents.

There are two types of pipelines:

- **Static**: pipelines that don't require runtime evaluations. Semaphore uses the pipeline directly as is to start the workflow
- **Dynamic**: contain elements that must be evaluated at runtime. Semaphore compiles it to generate a new pipeline that's used to start the workflow

If one or more of these elements are present, the pipeline is dynamic and must be compiled using an *initialization job*:

- [Change detection for monorepos](./optimization/monorepo): since Semaphore needs to evaluate the Git commit history to determine which files have changed
- [Job matrices](./jobs#matrix): since Semaphore needs to compute all the variable permutations
- [Parameterized promotions](./promotions#parameters): since parameter values are user-selected
- [Organization pre-flight checks](./org-preflight): because these commands must be  executed before the pipeline begins processing
- [Project pre-flight checks](./projects#preflight): because these commands must be executed before the pipeline begins processing

### Initialization job {#init-job}

The initialization job runs in a dedicated [initialization agent](#init-agent) and performs the following steps:

1. Clones the repository using Git
2. Compiles the YAML tree with [Semaphore Pipeline Compiler](https://github.com/semaphoreci/spc) (spc)
3. Executes organization pre-flight checks, if any
4. Executes project pre-flight checks, if any
5. Saves the job output log

:::info

The Semaphore Pipeline Compiler (spc) is an open-source component. You can find the code in the [spc repository](https://github.com/semaphoreci/spc)

:::

### How to change the init agent {#init-agent}

You can change the agent that runs the initialization job in two instances:

- **Organization**: affects all projects in the organization. See [organization init agent](./organizations#init-agent) to learn how to change this setting
- **Project**: changes the agent running initialization for a single project. See [project pre-flight checks](./projects#preflight) to learn how to change this setting

### How to access init logs {#init-logs}

Semaphore shows an **Initializing** message for pipelines that require an initialization job. You can see the log by clicking on the **See log** link at the top of the pipeline.

![See logs link](./img/init-log.jpg)

Following the link shows the complete job log.

![Example init job log](./img/init-log-example.jpg)

## Connecting pipelines 

[Promotions](./promotions) connect pipelines to implement continuous delivery and deployment, or any other kind of automation. Multiple pipelines can be chained to create branching workflows to automate almost any task.

The workflow always starts with the default pipeline (located at `.semaphore/semaphore.yml`) and flows from left to right following promotions.

![A workflow with 3 pipelines](./img/workflows.jpg)

For more information, see the [Promotions documentation](./promotions).

## Pipeline settings {#settings}

Pipeline settings are applied to all its blocks. You can change pipeline settings with the editor or directly in the YAML. 

### Agents {#agents}

Agents are the environment where jobs run. Semaphore keeps a pool of warm agents to ensure there's always one ready to work.

Semaphore Cloud provides the following agent types in x86 and ARM architectures:

- [Linux Machines](../reference/machine-types#linux) presented as VMs or [Docker containers](#docker-environments)
- [Apple macOS Machines](../reference/machine-types#macos)
- [Windows Machines](./self-hosted-install#windows) (only for self-hosted agents) 

:::info

Register your own machines as agents by [installing self-hosted agents](./self-hosted).

:::

To select the agent running your jobs by default:

<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the pipeline
2. Select the **Environment Type**
3. Select the **Operating System**
4. Select the [machine type](../reference/machine-types)

The available hardware changes depending on the type of environment you selected.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
(../reference/machine-types)
1. Add the `agent` and `machine` keys
2. Add the hardware `type`. The value must be one of the supported [machine types](../reference/machine-types)
3. Add the `os_image`. The value must be one of the supported operating systems

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0

# highlight-start
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004

          commands:
            - checkout
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Docker containers {#docker-environments}

:::tip

If you want to build and run Docker images in your jobs, check the [working with Docker page](./optimization/docker).

:::

Jobs can run inside Docker containers. This allows you to define a custom-build environment with pre-installed tools and dependencies needed for your project. You can enable this setting in the pipeline agent or in the [block agent override](./jobs#agent-override).

You can run multiple containers at the same time. The job runs in the first container (called `main`) and attaches the other containers to the same network. This is similar to how containers inside a Kubernetes pod communicate. 

The network addresses of all containers are mapped to their names. Let's say you have two containers, "main" and "mysql", you can connect to the database from main with:

```shell title="container 'main'"
mysql --host=mysql --user=root
```

To run the job inside a Docker container:

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the pipeline
2. In **Environment Types** select **Docker Container(s)**
3. Select the [machine type](../reference/machine-types)
4. Type the **Image** name for this container
5. Optionally, add environment variables
6. Optionally, add more containers

![Setting Docker environments](./img/agent-docker.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Add the `agent` and `machine`
2. Add a `containers` key
3. Each list item is a container. The first one must be called `main`
4. Add the `image`
5. Optionally, add `env_vars`
6. Optionally, add more containers

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"

      image: nginx
  # highlight-end
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - 'curl http://web'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning

Due to the introduction of [Docker Hub rate limits](./optimization/docker#dockerhub), Semaphore automatically redirects image pulls from the Docker Hub repository to the [Semaphore Container Registry](./optimization/container-registry).

:::

### Prologue {#prologue}

Commands in the *prologue* run before the commands in all blocks. Semaphore will preprend these commands to every job contained in the pipeline. This works like the [block prologue](./jobs#prologue) but for all blocks in the pipeline.

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Epilogue {#epilogue}

Commands in the *epilogue* run at the end of the jobs in all blocks. Semaphore will append these commands to every job contained in the pipeline.  This works like the [block epilogue](./jobs#epilogue) but for all blocks in the pipeline.

### Execution time limit {#time-limit}

The time limit for job execution. Defaults to 1 hour. Jobs running longer that the limit are forcibly terminated.

### Fail-fast {#fail-fast}

Changes Semaphore behavior when a job fails. The possible actions are:

- **Stop**: stop all running jobs
- **Cancel**: already-running jobs are allowed to finish

The available strategies are:

- **Do nothing**: fail fast is disabled
- **Stop all remaining jobs**: stops the jobs
- **Cancel pending jobs**: cancels the jobs
- **Stop remaining jobs, unless on the master branch**: stops the jobs except when the current branch is "master"
- **Run a custom fail-fast strategy**: define custom conditions for stop and cancel. Uses the [conditions DSL](../reference/conditions-dsl)

### Auto-cancel {#auto-cancel}

Define what happens when changes are pushed to the remote repository while a pipeline is running. By default, all pipelines will enter a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue and be executed in turn.

The possible strategies when a new pipeline is queued are:

- **running**: stops and cancels all pipelines in the queue. Starts the new pipeline immediately
- **queued**: cancels queued but no-yet-started pipelines. Waits for running pipelines to finish before starting the new one

The options are:

- **Do nothing**: disables auto-cancel
- **Cancel all pipelines, both running and queued**: stops running pipelines and cancel queued pipelines
- **Cancel only queued pipelines**: cancels queued pipelines, wait for already-started pipelines to finish
- **On the master branch cancel only queued pipelines, on others cancel both running and queued**: a mix of the last two strategies
- **Run a custom auto-cancel strategy**: define custom conditions for stop and cancel. Uses the [conditions DSL](../reference/conditions-dsl)

### After pipeline jobs {#after-pipeline-job}

You can configure jobs to run once a pipeline stops, even if it ended due to a failure, stopped, or canceled.

After-pipeline jobs are executed in parallel. Typical use cases for after-pipeline jobs are sending notifications, collecting [test reports](./tests/test-reports), or submitting metrics to an external server.

You can add after-pipeline jobs using YAML or the editor.

## Pipeline queues

Queues allow you to control the order in which pipelines Semaphore can run pipelines sequentially or in parallel depending on the queue configuration. For example, you can run pipelines in parallel on the main branch, while limiting only one production deploy pipeline to run at a time to prevent deployment conflicts.

### Default and named queues {#named-queues}

Semaphore creates a queue for each Git push or a pull requests. All workflows sharing the same commit SHA belong in the same queue and run sequentially. 

In other words, every you rerun a workflow, create a pull request, push a tag, or start a [promotion](./pipelines#connecting-pipelines), the pipeline is added to the end of the same-commit queue.

![Default queue behavior](./img/default-queues.jpg)

The downside of this stategy is that it may create conflicts due to pipelines running in parallel. In the example above, two deploy pipelines may try to deploy conflicting versions into the same environment, leading to instability.

You can avoid conflics with named queues. Named queues allow you to manually assign pipelines to specific queues to they always run in sequence.

![Named queued used to avoid deployment conflicts](./img/named-queues.jpg)

In the example above we have two queues. The "main" queue runs continuous integration pipelines for all commits. The possibly-disrupting deployment pipelines are assigned to a separate "deployment" queue. Thus, deployments are forced to run in sequence, avoiding conflics due to parallelism.

### Queue scopes {#queue-scopes}

Queues can be configured on two scopes:

- **Project** (the default): pipelines belonging to the same [project](./projects)
- **Organization**: pipelines belonging to all projects withing an [organization](./organizations)

### How to assign named queues {#assign-queue}

Queues can only be defined using the [pipeline YAML](../reference/pipeline-yaml). There is currently no support for queue management using the visual editor.

To assign a pipeline to a named queue, follow these steps:

1. Open the pipeline file
2. Add `queue`, `name` and `scope` at the root level of the YAML
3. Save the file and push it to the repository

The following example shows how to assign the pipeline to project-level queue called "Deployment queue".

```yaml title="Pipeline assigned to a project-level queue"
version: v1.0
name: Production deployment
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
# highlight-start
queue:
  name: Deployment queue
  scope: project
# highlight-end
blocks:
  - name: Deploy
    task:
      jobs:
      - commands:
          - make deploy
```

We can do the same with organization-level queues. This example shows how to assign the pipeline a queue called "Shared deployment queue" for all projects in the organization.

```yaml title="Pipeline assigned to an organization-level queue"
version: v1.0
name: Project A deployment
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
# highlight-start
queue:
  name: Shared deployment queue
  scope: organization
# highlight-end
blocks:
  - name: Deploy
    task:
      jobs:
      - commands:
          - make deploy
```

### How to disable queues {#disable-queues}

You can force pipelines to run in parallel by disabling queuing. This can help to obtain faster feedback when pipelines are completely independent and have no chance of causing conflicts.

To disable queue for a pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Open the pipeline file
2. Add `queue`, `processing: parallel` at the root level of the YAML
3. Save the file and push it to the repository

The following example shows a pipeline that always runs in parallel. As soon as an agent is available, the pipeline starts.

```yaml title="Pipeline that always runs in parallel"
version: v1.0
name: Tests
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
# highlight-start
queue:
  processing: parallel
# highlight-end
blocks:
  - name: Unit Tests
    task:
      jobs:
      - commands:
          - make test
```

### Conditional queues {#conditional-queues}

You can use conditional statements to assign pipelines based on parameters like branch name or tag name. 

The following example uses three rules:

- On "master" branch: assign pipeline to organization queue called "Production"
- When the commit includes any Git tag: assign pipeline to project-level queue called "Image build queue"
- If none of the other rule match: default to running pipeline in parallel (no queue)

```yaml title="Conditional queue example"
version: v1.0
name: Example project
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
# highlight-start
queue:
  - when: "branch = 'master'"
    name: Production
    scope: organization
  - when: "tag =~ '.*'"
    name: Image build queue
  - when: true
    processing: parallel
# highlight-end
blocks:
  - name: Unit Tests
    task:
      jobs:
      - commands:
          - make test
  - name: Build and push image
    run:
      when: "branch = 'master' or tag =~ '.*'"
    task:
      jobs:
      - commands:
          - make image.build
          - make image.push
  - name: Deploy to production
    run:
      when: "branch = 'master'"
    task:
      jobs:
      - commands:
          - make deploy
```
