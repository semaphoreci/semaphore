Every organization on Semaphore Cloud is tied to a billing plan.

To see your spending:

<Steps>

2. Select **Plans & Billing**
3. The overview tab shows your monthly spending

4. You can view detailed breakdowns in three ways

    - **Spending**: shows costs due to machine usage, storage and egress
    - **Projects**: shows the costs generated by your most active projects

</Steps>

## How Spending is Calculated

In addition to subscription cost, your monthly bill is determined by your usage of the following four groups of resources:

- **Machine Time** - the cost of using Semaphore Cloud machines (calculated by the minute)
- **Storage and Egress** - the cost of storing and downloading your build artifacts
- **Add-ons** - additional features or services offered by Semaphore Cloud (e.g. priority support, a dedicated cache server)

You can monitor your monthly spending at any time on the [Plans & Billing](#spending) page within the app. Please note that spending data may take up to 24 hours to update.

## How machine usage is billed

Semaphore charges you based on the machine type used and the amount of time spent running. The timer starts when a job enters the running state and ends once the job is finished. Jobs that take less than one minute to complete will be rounded up to a full minute for billing purposes.

:::info

"Only running time is billed" Please note that time spent in the queue state due to concurrency limits or pipeline queues is not counted towards machine time used.
