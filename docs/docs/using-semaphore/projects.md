Projects are codebases developed and managed through Semaphore [Continuous Integration](https://semaphoreci.com/continuous-integration). A project links your Git repository with Semaphore, so it can run [jobs](./jobs) to test, build, or deploy your application. 

This page explains how to set up projects and what settings are available.

## Create a project

<VideoTutorial title="Create a Project" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4Ac5EJpzEc?si=INZVrNw4LTWg3l6k"/>

To create a Semaphore project you need:

- A [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com) account with an [organization](./organizations.md)
- A GitHub or Bitbucket account. For more information, see the connection guides
  - [How to connect to GitHub](./connect-github)
  - [How to connect to Bitbucket](./connect-bitbucket)
- A repository with at least one commit

<Tabs groupId="ui-cli">
<TabItem value="ui" label="UI">

Go to Semaphore, press **+Create New** 1 and then press **Choose repository**

![Creating a new project](./img/create-project-1.jpg)

1. Select the GitHub or Bitbucket tab. You may need to press the **Connect account** button if this is the first time
2. Select the repository from the list and press on **Choose**
    <details>
    <summary>Show me</summary>
    <div>
    ![Select repository](./img/create-project-2.jpg)
    </div>
    </details>
3. Optionally, [add people](./organizations#people) to the project. Press **Continue**
    <details>
    <summary>Show me</summary>
    <div>
    ![Add people](./img/create-project-3.jpg)
    </div>
    </details>
4. Select a started workflow. If in doubt, select **Single Job** and **Start**
    <details>
    <summary>Show me</summary>

Semaphore creates a new [pipeline](./pipelines) file in the `.semaphore` folder in the repository and starts working.

![Project created](./img/project-created.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

After installing and connecting the [Semaphore command line](../reference/semaphore-cli):

1. Clone the repository in your machine
2. Run `sem init` at the root of the repository
3. Push a change to get Semaphore working
 
 ```shell title="Push pipeline to the repository
    git add .semaphore
    git commit "Initalize Semaphore"
    git push origin main
 ```

![Project created](./img/project-created.jpg)

You can override the project name and URL by using [additional options](../reference/semaphore-cli#sem-edit)

```shell
sem init --project-name <project_name> --project-url <project_url>
```

If you get permission or not find error message, double check the connection between Semaphore and your Git provider:
- [How to connect to GitHub](./connect-github)
- [How to connect to Bitbucket](./connect-bitbucket)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## View projects {#view-projects}

<Tabs groupId="ui-cli">
<TabItem value="ui" label="UI">

You can find your projects in Semaphore by pressing on the **Projects** tab and searching by project name.

![Searching for projects](./img/find-project.jpg)

Semaphore shows the latest activity in the last few days when logging in. 

![Project activity](./img/project-activity.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To get the list of the projects in your organization:

1. If needed, [switch the context](./organizations#org-selection) to your organization
2. Run [sem get](../reference/semaphore-cli) to list your projects

```shell
$ sem get project
NAME                                 REPOSITORY
semaphore-demo-flutter               git@github.com:semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-flutter.git
hello-semaphore                      git@github.com:semaphoreci-demos/hello-semaphore.git
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Access roles {#people}

Add people to the project to let them view or administrate it. Semaphore uses role-based permissions to manage access to projects.

The available roles are:

- **Admin**: admins can change any setting in the project, add or remove people, and even delete the project altogether
- **Contributor**: contributors can view, change [pipelines](./pipelines) and re-run them. They can also start [promotions](./promotions), view insights and [tasks](./tasks)
- **Reader**: readers can view the project's page, and view results and jobs logs. They can't make any modifications to the project

### How to add/remove people {#people-add}

:::note

You must add individuals to your Git repository and to your [Semaphore organization](./organizations#people) before you can add them to your project.

:::

Open your project and go to the **People** tab

1. Press **Add People**
2. Select the user from the list of options
3. Select the role
4. Press **Add Selected**

![Adding a member to the project](./img/add-user-2.jpg)

### How to change permissions {#people-roles}

Open your project and go to the **People** tab

1. Press the **Change role** next to the project member
2. Select the new role

![Changing a members role](./img/change-role.jpg)

## Project tabs {#manage-projects}

Project members can view or manage the following project elements:

- **Activity**: shows the latest [pipeline](./pipelines) runs
- **Deployments**: access the [project's environment](./promotions#deployment-targets) (formerly deployment targets)
- **Insights**: shows the [insights](./optimization/insights)
- **Artifacts**: shows the [project-level artifacts](./artifacts#projects) and [retention policy](./artifacts#retention)
- **Tasks**: shows the [tasks](./tasks)
- **Flaky Tests**: shows the [flaky tests](./tests/flaky-tests) detected in the project
- **People**: shows the [project members](#people)
- **Settings**: shows the [project-level settings](#settings)

![Project tabs](./img/project-tabs.jpg)

## Settings {#settings}

The **Settings** tab in your project allows you to customize your project settings, add project-level secrets, and manage [artifacts](./artifacts)

### General settings {#general}

In the general project settings, you can: 

- Change the owner of the project. The new owner [must be already part](#people-add) of the project.
- Change the visibility and make the project publicly-viewable
- Change the project name or description
- Delete the project

![General settings](./img/project-general-settings-1.jpg)

In addition, you can select when the project is triggered:

- **Do not run on any events** disables automatic runs on Semaphore. You can still run workflows manually or with [tasks](./tasks)
- **Run on** lets you enable or disable running workflows on Semaphore on branches, tags, pull requests, and forked pull requests.
- You can create an allow list for branches and tags

![General settings](./img/project-general-settings-2.jpg)

### Repository {#settings-repo}

In **Repository** settings page you can:

- change the URL of your Git repository if you moved it
- configure or reinstall the [GitHub](./connect-github) or [Bitbucket](./connect-bitbucket) connections
- regenerate the [git webhook](./connect-github) if Semaphore is not picking up on the remote changes

![Repository settings](./img/project-settings-reop.jpg)

### Project secrets {#project-secrets}

In **Secrets** page, you can create project-level [secrets](./secrets.md). These are only accessible for this project and not globally to all the organizations.

To learn how to create project secrets, see the [secrets documentation page](./secrets#create-project-secrets).

Project roles: https://docs.semaphoreci.com/security/default-roles/

### Badges

The **Badge** settings page shows you [shields](https://shields.io/) embed codes for your README or any webpage, allowing team members and users about the build status of your project.

To get a badge embed code:

1. Type the branch name you want to show the status for. This is typically "main" or "master"
2. Select a badge style. This is only a style choice
3. Choose the file format where you will embed the badge
4. Copy the code into your README or webpage

![Using project badges](./img/project-badges.jpg)

### Artifacts

The **Artifacts** settings page lets you configure the [artifact](./artifacts) retention policy.

To learn more, see the [artifacts retention page](./artifacts#retention)

## Pre-flight checks {#preflight}

<Available plans={['Scaleup']}/>

Pre-flight checks are user-defined commands executed before the pipeline begins as part of the pipeline [initialization job](./pipelines#init-job). They checks allow you to define the type of agent running the initialization job and to manually run commands before a pipeline starts.

:::note

If you want to run commands for all pipelines in your organization, see [organization pre-flight checks](./org-preflight).

:::

### How to set up checks {#preflight-add}

To create, edit, or delete project pre-flight checks, follow these steps:

1. Open the project on Semaphore
2. Go to the **Settings** tab
3. Select **Pre-flight checks**
4. Type the pre-flight commands
5. Optionally, type the name of [secrets](./secrets) to be injected during the initialization job
6. Press **Save changes**

![Setting up pre-flight checks for project](./img/project-preflight.jpg)

See the [organization pre-flight page](./org-preflight#env-vars) to learn about the available environment variables and see examples of pre-flight checks.

### How to change init agent {#init-agent}

You can change the agent in which the initialization and pre-flight commands run.

To change the initialization for the project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Pre-flight settings page](#preflight-add)
2. Check the box **Override default agent configuration**
3. Select an **Environment type**
4. Select a **Machine type**
5. Select an **OS image**
6. Press **Save changes**

![Changing the initialization agent for the project](./img/override-project-init-agent.jpg)

:::note

This setting overrides the [organization-wide initialization agent](./organizations#init-agent).
