Project Insights provides productivity metrics about your [CI pipelines](../pipelines). You can, for instance, how long your pipelines take on average and the number of workflow runs in a given period. Use this information to assess the productivity of your development team.

## How to view project insights {#view}

Project Insights are available in the **Insights** tab on your [project](../projects). Data is loaded automatically from your CI workflow activity, however, you can [configure Insights](#configure) to ensure you're seeing the data accurately.

![Location of the insights tab](./img/insights-tab.jpg)

You can select which [metric to view](#metrics) using the left-side menu. 

On the right side, you can change the date range for the data shown.

### How to configure insights {#configure}

Semaphore tries to guess which is the main branch in your project. However, to be sure the metrics are shown accurately, it's recommended to configure the branch and [pipeline file](../pipelines#overview) in the settings menu.

The Project Insights settings are split into two sections:

- **Continuous Integration**: this is your project's main pipeline. It should build and run your tests
- **Continuous Deployment**: optional. This pipeline deploys your application to production

Follow the steps below to set up Project Insights:

<Steps>

1. Open the **Insights** tab
2. Click on the Gear Icon on the left side
3. Set the main branch name for your project in the **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** sections
4. Set the name of the pipeline file in the **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** sections
5. Press **Save Changes**

</Steps>

:::note

The pipeline file path should be relative to the repository's root.

After you save changes, Semaphore will start collecting metrics for Project Insights.

## Metrics available {#metrics}

The available metrics are performance, frequency, and reliability. Each metric shows the data for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. You can also create [custom dashboards](#custom) to refine your views.

Metrics data is held for 30 days and updated every 24 hours.

### Performance

Performance metrics show how long pipelines take to run on average. The graph shows the median time (p50) and the standard deviation.

![CI performance graph](./img/perf-ci.jpg)

Below the Continuous Integration graph, you can select which branch to view.

If you have [configured Continuous Deployment insights](#configure), you can also see data for the deployment branch.

### Frequency

Frequency metrics show the number of pipelines run per week and the total number of runs for all pipelines per day.

![CI frequency graph](./img/freq-ci.jpg)

Below the Continuous Integration graph, you can select which branch to view.

If you have [configured Continuous Deployment insights](#configure), you can also see data for the deployment branch. 

![CD frequency graph](./img/freq-cd.jpg)

### Reliability

Reliability metrics provide an overview of the pipeline pass rate. In other words, it tells you how frequently the pipeline was disrupted by a [job](../jobs) failure. The graph also shows the mean time it takes to recover from a failed pipeline run and when the last successful run was.

If you have [configured Continuous Deployment insights](#configure), you can also see data for the deployment branch.

## How to create custom dashboards {#custom}

Create your own visualization with custom dashboards. You can add any metric already available on the Project Insights page to the dashboard.

To create a Dashboard:

<Steps>

1. Open the Project Insights
2. On the left side, click on the plus sign (+)
3. Enter the name of the dashboard
    ![Creating a custom dashboard](./img/custom-create.jpg)
4. Press **Create**

</Steps>

You can also create dashboards using the command line. See [Semaphore Command Line](../../reference/semaphore-cli) and [Dashboard YAML reference](../../reference/dashboard-yaml) for more details.

Once created, you can add metrics to the dashboard following these steps:


<Steps>

1. Open the custom dashboard on the left side
2. Press the **Add metric** button
3. Fill the form:
    - (A) Type the metric name
    - (B) Select the metric type to show from the
    - (C) Type the branch name you want to visualize
    - (D) Type the pipeline file path for the pipeline you want to visualize
    - (E) Type an optional description
4. Press **Save**

</Steps>

:::note

After you save, a new Metric chart will appear on the Dashboard. It may take up to two days for data to populate the new chart.
