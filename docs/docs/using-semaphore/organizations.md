Organizations are the administrative unit for Semaphore. This page explains how to set up [notifications](./notifications), manage users, and what settings are available.

## Overview {#overview}

The first time you log in to Semaphore you'll be prompted to create an *organization*. An organization is the basic unit of administration. 

Organizations have:

- zero or more [projects](./projects)
- a [billing plan](./plans)
- one or more owners
- users and groups with role-based permissions

## How to change organizations {#org-selection}

Switch the active organization to change its settings or view its projects.

<Tabs groupId="ui-cli">
<TabItem value="ui" label="UI">

To view or create other organizations, open the organization menu on the top right corner and select **Change Organization**.

![Organization menu location](./img/organization-menu.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You must install and connect the [Semaphore command line](../reference/semaphore-cli) to access your organizations

1. Run `sem context` to show the organizations connected to the tool. The active organization has an asterisk (*) next to it
    ```shell title="View connected organizations"
    $ sem context
        myorg1_semaphoreci_com
        myorg2_semaphoreci_com
        # highlight-next-line
      * myorg3_semaphoreci_com
    ```
2. Change organization with `sem context <organization-name>`
    ```shell title="Change active organization"
    $ sem context myorg1_semaphoreci_com
    switched to context "myorg1_semaphoreci_com"
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Managing users {#people}

Semaphore uses roles to manage user access. You can add an unlimited number of persons to your organization.

To manage users in your organization, open the organization menu and select **People**.

:::info

The *URL of your organization* is the URL that leads to the Home page in your Semaphore organization. By default it follows the pattern `your-organization-name.semaphoreci.com`

:::

### Notifications {#slack-notifications}

You can set up Slack and other webhook-based notifications to get your team notified whenever there [project](./projects) finishes running.

To learn more, see the [notificaction documentation](./notifications.md)

### Initialization jobs {#initialization-jobs}

Configure how pipelines are initialized.

Semaphore must run some initialiation steps before it can start a [pipeline](./pipelines). It must fetch and validate the pipeline YAML and, in some cases like [monorepos](./optimization/monorepo) or [pre-flight checks](./preflight), even do a full repository clone.

By default, Semaphore chooses automatically which kind of [agent](./pipelines#agents) run the initialization job, but in this section you can customize it for all [projects](./projects).

![Customizing a the initialization job agent](./img/organization-settings-initialization.jpg)

### Okta integration {#okta-integration}

<Available plans={['Scaleup']} />

Integration with Okta allows you to automate user management within your Semaphore organization, as well as to use Okta apps for Single Sign On.

For more information, see the [Okta integration page](./okta.md)

### Contacts {#contacts}

In this section, you can add contact details in case the Semaphore Support Team needs to reach you. Add your name, phone number and email in three categories:

- **Finance**: used any billing-related messaging related to your organization
- **Main**: used as the primary point of communication
- **Security**: used to discuss any issues related to security in your organization

## Audit logs {#audit-log}

<Available plans={['Scaleup']} />

To support compliance, accountability, and security, Semaphore provides logs of audited events. Audit Log events are events that affect your organization, projects, users, or any other resources in Semaphore. Events contain information about when who and what was the performed activity.

You can find audit logs in your organization settings under Audit Logs.

![Audit logs location](./img/audit-log-location.jpg)

The audit logs shows all the [audited events](../reference/audit-events) in reverse cronological order. Latest events are shown first.

![Audit log example](./img/audit-logs-example.jpg)

### How to export audit logs {#audit-export}

<Available plans={['Scaleup']} />

Audit logs can be exported in two ways:

- CSV file
- Streaming to an S3-compatible bucket

To export the logs as CSV, press the **Export as CSV** button.

![Exporting as CSV](./img/audit-export-csv.jpg)

To configure streaming to an S3-compatible bucket, press the **Configure Streaming** button and:

1. Select between AWS and Google Cloud
2. Type the region (AWS only)
3. Type the bucket name
4. Type the access token. They should have write access to the bucket
5. Press **Looks Good**

![Configuring Audit log streaming](./img/audit-log-streaming.jpg)

:::info

Audit logs are streamed to the bucket once per day.

![Activity monitor quotas](./img/activity-monitor-quotas.jpg)

In the lower part of the activity monitor you can find the currently running workflows for all the [projects](./projects) in your organization. Use this to know what [jobs](./jobs) are running, and see which ones are waiting in the queue to debug usage issues.

![Activity monitor workflows](./img/activity-monitor-workflows.jpg)
