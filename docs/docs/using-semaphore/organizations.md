Organizations are the administrative unit for Semaphore. This page explains how to set up [notifications](./notifications), manage users, and what settings are available.

## Overview {#overview}

The first time you log in to Semaphore you'll be prompted to create an *organization*. An organization is the basic unit of administration. 

Organizations have:

- zero or more [projects](./projects)
- a [billing plan](./plans)
- one or more owners
- users and groups with role-based permissions

## How to change organizations {#org-selection}

Switch the active organization to change its settings or view its projects.

<Tabs groupId="ui-cli">
<TabItem value="ui" label="UI">

To view or create other organizations, open the organization menu on the top right corner and select **Change Organization**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You must install and connect the [Semaphore command line](../reference/semaphore-cli) to access your organizations

<Steps>

1. Run `sem context` to show the organizations connected to the tool. The active organization has an asterisk (*) next to it
    ```shell title="View connected organizations"
    $ sem context
        myorg1_semaphoreci_com
        myorg2_semaphoreci_com
        # highlight-next-line
      * myorg3_semaphoreci_com
    ```
2. Change organization with `sem context <organization-name>`
    ```shell title="Change active organization"
    $ sem context myorg1_semaphoreci_com
    switched to context "myorg1_semaphoreci_com"
