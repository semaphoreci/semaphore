This guide will help build Swift projects on Semaphore.

## Overview

Semaphore allows the building, testing, and releasing of Swift, Objective-C, and React Native applications using macOS environments.

See [macOS](../../reference/os-apple) to view the available Xcode versions.

## Building Swift code {#compile}

To build a Swift application, select one of the macOS environments and compile your code with `xcodebuild`.

```shell
checkout
xcodebuild
```

See [artifacts](../artifacts) to learn how to save and persist the built binary.
