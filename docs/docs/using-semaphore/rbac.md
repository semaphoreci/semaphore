Manage user permissions in your organization and projects with Role Based Access Control (RBAC). This page describes gives an overview of RBAC, how to assign roles to users and groups, and how to create custom roles.

## Overview

Semaphore uses a RBAC model to determine what actions users can take in organizations and projects.

An organization [Admin](#org-admin) or [Owner](#org-owner) must invite users via their GitHub or BitBucket accounts before they can access the Semaphore organization or any of the projects.

### Role scopes {#scopes}

Semaphore manages roles on two levels:

- [Organization](#org): these roles allow users to perform various organizational actions. Users need to be added to the organization before they can access projects.
- [Project](#project): these roles give access to a [project](./projects) within the organization. Users need to have access to the repository connected to the project.

Roles can be gained in three ways:

- **Direct**: you can directly assign up to one organization role and one project role to the user
- **Group**: you can grant roles to [groups](#org-groups). Group members gain the role assigned to the group
- **Repository**: users may gain project permissions based on their roles in the related repository (only on GitHub)

### Permissions are additive {#additive}

Permissions are additive. Users gaining permissions through multiple ways obtain the combined total of all permissions.

For example, let's say Pam has [admin](#org-admin) role in the organization. This gives her unfettered access to all the projects in the organization. If Kevin gives her the [reader](#project-reader) role in one project, she is still effectively admin in that project. In other words, roles never substract permissions.

## Organization roles {#org}

Organization roles control what actions the users may perform in Semaphore. Users need to be added to the organization via their GitHub or BitBucket usernames before they can be granted a role. Only users who are part of the organization can log in to Semaphore.

The only exception is when a user is added via the [Okta integration](./okta).

### Member {#org-member}

Organization members can access the organization's homepage and the projects they are assigned to. They can't modify any settings.

This is the default role assigned when a user is added to the organization.

Among other actions, members can:

- View the organization's activity
- View and manage dashboards
- View and manage [notifications](./notifications)
- Create [projects](./projects)
- View and manage [secrets](./secrets)
- View and manage [self-hosted agents](./self-hosted)

For the full list of member permissions, see [organization roles](./organizations#org-roles).

### Admin {#org-admin}

Admins can modify settings within the organization or any of its projects. They do not have access to billing information, and they cannot change general organization details, such as the organization name and URL.

Only Admins and Owners can invite users to the organization.

In addition to the [member permissions](#org-member), admins can:

- View and manage organization settings
- View and manage the [Okta integration](./okta)
- Invite users to the organization
- Remove people from the organization
- View and manage billing plans
- View and manage [pre-flight checks](./org-preflight)
- View and manage [usage policy for secrets](./secrets#secret-access-policy)

For the full list of admin permissions, see [organization roles](./organizations#org-roles).

### Owner {#org-owner}

The owner of the organization is the person that created it. An organization can have multiple owners.  Owners have access to all functionalities within the organization and any of its projects. Only Admins and Owners can invite users to the organization.

For the full list of owner permissions, see [organization roles](./organizations#org-roles).

To remove an owner, see [how to remove an owner](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/using-semaphore/organizations#remove-owner).

### Organization groups {#org-groups}

<Available plans={['Scaleup']}/>

Your organization can have any number of groups. A group can have exactly one role directly assigned.

Groups can be added to the project and assigned exactly to [project-level role](#project). This grants every member of the group access to the project and grants them all the permissions inherited from the roles.

## Project roles {#project}

Project roles control what actions the users may perform on the project. Project roles are assigned per project.

To grant a user access to a given project they need to:

- Be part of the Semaphore organization
- Have access to the related repository in GitHub or BitBucket
- Be granted access to the Semaphore project

The role given when a user is added to the project depends on their repository-level role. The following table shows how repository permissions map to project roles.

| GitHub repo role | BitBucket repo role | Semaphore project role | 
|--|--|--|
|Pull|Read|[Reader](#project-reader)|
|Push|Write|[Contributor](#project-contributor)|
|Admin|Admin|[Contributor](#project-contributor)|

### Reader {#project-reader}

Readers can access the project page, and view workflows, their results, and job logs. They cannot make any modifications to the project.

Readers have:

- Read-only access to [artifacts](./artifacts)
- Read-only access to [deployment targets (environment)](./promotions#deployment-targets)
- Read-only access to [test reports](./tests/test-reports) and [flaky tests](./tests/flaky-tests)
- Read-only access to [tasks](./tasks)
- View project notifications
- View project [pre-flight checks](./projects#preflight)

For the full list of reader permissions, see [project roles](./projects#project-roles).

### Contributor {#project-contributor}

Contributors can view, rerun, change workflows, and SSH into jobs. Can promote and view insights, and run schedulers.

In addition to the [reader permisions](#project-reader), contributors can:

- Delete the project
- Change project settings
- Manage project [pre-flight checks](./projects#preflight)
- Manage [test reports](./tests/test-reports) and [flaky tests](./tests/flaky-tests)
- Manage [tasks](./tasks)

For the full list of contributor permissions, see [project roles](./projects#project-roles).

### Admin {#project-admin}

Admins have the authority to modify any setting within the projects, including the ability to add new individuals or remove them.

## Custom roles {#custom-roles}

<Available plans={['Scaleup']}/>

In addition to the pre-defined roles provided by Semaphore, you can create your custom own roles. Custom roles let you follow the principle of least privilege when managing using permissions.

To manage custom roles, see the following pages:

- [How to manage organization custom roles](./organizations#custom)
- [How to manage project custom roles](./projects#custom-roles)
