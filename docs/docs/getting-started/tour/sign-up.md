You will need a Semaphore account to follow this guided tour. Don't worry, the only thing you will need is an account on GitHub or BitBucket.

In this section we'll learn about:

- What's the purpose of CI/CD?
- Creating an account
- Creating an organization
- Overview of the Semaphore homepage

:::note

If you already have or have been invited to an organization, you can skip directly to the [next step](./hello-world).

## Why do I need CI/CD?

Continuous Integration (CI) is an automated process of regularly merging code changes, running tests, and providing rapid feedback to developers.

CI enables developers to frequently merge code changes, automatically test them, and detect integration issues early, leading to faster development cycles and higher-quality software.

Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment extend this process by providing a package you can release and deploy to the world. The whole thing is automated and can be set up to not need human intervention. No more stressing over deployment or releases!

## Prerequisites

To create your Semaphore account you need a [GitHub](https://github) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) account.

## Sign up to Semaphore

Before you can start using Semaphore, you need to create an account:

<Steps>

1. Go to [semaphoreci.com](https://semaphoreci.com)
2. Press **Start Building for Free**
3. Select one of the options: **Signup with GitHub** or **Signup with BitBucket**

4. If prompted, authorize Semaphore to continue

5. Type a name for your organization
    
    Your organization is the HQ for all your projects and teammates. 
    
    The organization's name determines the URL for your Semaphore homepage. My organization name is "keyboard-cowboys", so my URL is `keyboard-cowboys.semaphoreci.com`

    You can always change the organization name later.

6. Fill in the short survey. This helps us to know you and your needs better

7. Finally, select your plan

    You can test one of the paid plans (no credit card required) or sign up with a free plan forever. You can change this later.

8. Welcome to your new account

</Steps>

## Semaphore homepage

At this point, you should be seeing your organization's homepage. Let's get our bearings.

![Semaphore homepage](./img/homepage.jpg)

On the top left side you'll find:

- Project search box
- Project creation button

On the top right side, there is:

- The account menu 
- The organization menu

In the middle of the screen, you'll see the recent activity in your organization. Since we're just starting, nothing has happened yet.

## What is an organization?

An organization is the place where all your project and team members live. Your account can have as many organizations as you wish.

Since you created the organization, you are its Owner. That means you can do pretty much anything, including inviting people, granting and removing roles, creating projects, and even deleting the whole organization.

## What have you done so far?

- Created a Semaphore account
- Created your first organizations
- Learned the basics of organizations

## What's next?

In the next section, we'll create our first project.
