## Ways to Contribute

### Provide Feedback

We consider any feedback a valuable contribution. Before opening a new [issue](https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore/issues) or [discussion](https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore/discussions), please check and review the existing ones to avoid duplication.

If you want to contribute by providing feedback, you can:

1. Propose new topic, report an inaccuracy, lack of clarity, or missing information: [new issue template](https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore/issues/new?assignees=TomFern%2CAleksandarCole&labels=documentation&projects=semaphoreci%2F2&template=DOCS_ISSUE.yml&title=%5BDocs%5D%3A+)
2. Discuss the current state of the content or ask for clarification on any topic: [new discussion](https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore/discussions/new/choose)

### Update Documentation Content

If you are interested in updating the documentation content, here are a few paths to consider:

1. Read through the rest of this guide to learn how to contribute through PRs.
2. Pick the right topic:
   1. Browse our list of [help wanted](https://github.com/orgs/semaphoreci/projects/2/views/7) issues and pick one.
   2. Already have an improvement in mind? Feel free to move to the next step.
3. Create your first pull request by following this guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- You have a code editor, a GitHub account, and experience using command-line programs, including `git` commands.
- You have Node.js, version 18.x or newer, installed. 
   Run `node --version` to check if Node is installed.
   If you need to install or update Node, see 
   [Installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) 
   for instructions on how to download and install Node.js using a package manager.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Local Environment

To set up a local environment for contributing to Semaphore documentation:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer.

2. Clone or fork the repository

   - **External Contributors** (no write access to upstream): navigate to [sempahoreci/semaphore](https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore), click **Fork**, then select **Create a new fork**. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/semaphore
   ```

   - If you are an **internal contributor** (you have write access to upstream): clone the [semaphoreci/semaphore](https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore) repository by running the following command:
  
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore 
      ```

3. Navigate to the `docs` directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

4. Update the documentation to the latest version from the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Working Branch

Create and switch to a new branch using the `git checkout -b` command:

```bash
git checkout -b <my-branch-name>
```

Follow this naming convention for your branch: `{group-token}/{issue number}/{concise-description}`

1. Use lowercase characters and `/` and `-` as separators for better readability.

   Example: `fix/592/jobs-page-link-fix`

2. Use group tokens at the beginning of the branch name to define the type of update. The tokens we use are:

   ```text
   fix       A change that fixes formatting, rendering issues, broken links, etc.
   lang      A change that improves language and readability without adding new content.
   update    Extending the content of existing pages or updating existing information.
   new       Adding new documentation pages or sections.
   dev       Updating the docs engine, CI/CD pipelines, or configuration.
   ```

3. Add a GitHub issue number. Use `no-ref` if there's no issue or `multi` if the change affects multiple issues.

   Examples: `new/521/pipelines-page`, `fix/no-ref/missing-screenshot`, `lang/multi/readability-update`

4. Use a descriptive and concise name that reflects the work done on the branch. Avoid long branch names.

## Step 3: Test Your Changes Locally

When making changes, ensure you follow the [Style Guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) and [UI Reference](UI-REFERENCE.md).

As you update the documentation, it's a good idea to test your changes locally before committing. 

### Run Linter

Make sure your changes follow proper Markdown syntax and there are no broken links. 
Push your changes only when the next two commands pass.

1. Run the linter to validate Markdown syntax
   
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. Build a local bundle to detect broken links
   
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Review Changes in Browser

As you make changes to the content in your local branch, it's helpful to see how the changes will be rendered when the documentation is published.

To test changes in your local environment:

1. Change to the top-level docs directory in your local copy of the `https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore` repository.

2. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to the documentation using the URL `localhost:3000`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

4. Once satisfied, try running the docs in a Docker container

   ```bash
   make image.build
   make image.run
   ```

   The site should be accessible on `localhost:3000`


## Step 4: Create a Pull Request

### Pull Request Etiquette

To ensure a smooth review process, please follow these best practices for your pull requests (PRs):

1. **Clear PR Title:** Use a concise and descriptive title for your PR that summarizes the changes (e.g., `Fix typo in Jobs Page`, `Updated Screenshot for Test Reports`).

2. **Detailed Description:** Provide a clear and detailed description of what your PR does. Include:
   - **What:** A summary of the changes made.
   - **Why:** The reason for the changes and any relevant background.
   - **How:** A brief explanation of how the changes were made, if not immediately obvious.

3. **Link to Issues:** If your PR addresses an existing issue, include a reference to it in the description (e.g., `Closes #123`).

4. **Checklist:** Ensure your PR meets all the contribution guidelines. Use a checklist to confirm:
   - [ ] The branch is up-to-date with the main branch.
   - [ ] Update follows the docs style guide.
   - [ ] Changes have been tested locally.

5. **Keep it Focused:** Limit your PR to a single purpose or issue. Multiple, unrelated changes should be divided into separate PRs.

6. **Be Ready for Feedback:** Be open to feedback and willing to make necessary changes. Engage in discussions constructively.

### How to create a Pull Request

1. Add files and commit changes to your local branch periodically with commands similar to the following:

   ```bash
   git add <new-file-name>                      # Add a specific new file to be committed
   git add -A                                   # Add all changed files to the list of files to be committed
   git commit -am "Fix or feature description"  # Add and commit changes with a comment
   git commit -m "Fix or feature description"   # Commit changes already added
   ```

2. Push your branch to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin <my-branch-name>
   ```

3. Create Pull Request

   - Navigate to the [semaphoreci/semaphore](https://github.com/semaphoreci/semaphore) repository

   - Above the list of files, in the yellow banner, click Compare & pull request to create a pull request for the associated branch.

   - **External Contributors**: On the page to create a new pull request, **click compare across forks**. 

   - In the "base branch" dropdown menu, select the branch of the upstream repository you'd like to merge changes into.
 
   - Select your branch as the branch to merge into `main`, then click **New pull request**.

   - Click the `preview` tab in the PR description form, select `Documentation` template and create the pull request after filling in the description.

4. Wait for the minimum required approvals, then merge your pull request as soon as possible. 

## Next Steps

- Refer to the [style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) to maintain consistency across your documentation page with the rest of the documentation.
- Explore the [UI components reference guide](UI-REFERENCE.md) to discover suitable UI components for your requirements.
