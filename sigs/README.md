# Semaphore Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

## Introduction

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are designed to foster collaboration between the Semaphore team, community members, and users. The primary purpose of SIGs is to:

1. Enable community members and users to actively participate in the Semaphore design
2. Provide a platform for sharing experiences and use-cases
3. Allow participants to help shape specific product areas
4. Influence the development and direction of these product areas

By joining a SIG, you have the opportunity to contribute your expertise, insights, and real-world experiences to help improve Semaphore. Whether you're a long-time user, a new community member, or someone with a unique perspective on a particular aspect of Semaphore, your input is valuable in driving it forward.

SIGs serve as a bridge between the core Semaphore team and the wider community, ensuring that development is aligned with user needs and industry trends.

## Current SIGs

Semaphore currently has several active Special Interest Groups, each focusing on a specific area of the product. These SIGs are open for anyone to join and contribute to with the approval of sig owner. Below is a list of our current SIGs, their purposes, owners, and links to their respective spaces.

| Name | Purpose | Maintainers | Link to SIG Space |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| SIG-API and extensibility| Focuses on API development, and explores venues of extending Semaphore with various integrations | [@radwo](https://github.com/radwo) | [SIG-API Space](./api-and-extensibility/README.md) |
| SIG-Documentation | Ensures comprehensive and up-to-date Semaphore documentation | @TomFern | [SIG-Documentation Space](../docs/README.md) |

Each SIG meets regularly to discuss ongoing projects, address challenges, and plan future developments. We encourage you to explore these SIGs and join the ones that align with your interests or expertise.

### Future SIGs

As Semaphore continues to grow and evolve, we plan to expand our range of Special Interest Groups.

Here are some SIGs we're planning to establish in the near future:

- **SIG-Agents**: This group will focus on Semaphore self-hosted agents, working to improve their functionality, performance, and user experience.
- **SIG-Tests**: Dedicated to enhancing Semaphore's test reporting capabilities, this group will work on developing and refining test report parsers for various technology stacks.

If you're interested in these upcoming SIGs or have ideas for additional groups, we encourage you to reach out to the Semaphore team.

## How SIGs Operate

Special Interest Groups in Semaphore operate with a focus on collaboration, transparency, and community involvement. Here's an overview of how SIGs function:

### Regular Meetings

1. **Frequency**: SIGs typically meet on a regular schedule, often weekly or monthly.
2. **Format**: Meetings are usually held via video conference to accommodate global participation.
3. **Agenda**: Each meeting has a predefined agenda, which is shared in advance for input and preparation.
4. **Minutes**: Detailed minutes are taken and shared publicly to keep the wider community informed.

### Communication Channels

1. **Discord Channel**: Each SIG has a dedicated Discord channel for ongoing discussions and quick communications.
2. **GitHub Discussions**: For technical discussions and proposals, SIGs use GitHub Discussions within the Semaphore repository.
3. **RFCs**: For more in-depth collaboration on proposal, SIGs use [RFCs](../rfcs/README.md).

### Decision Making

1. **Consensus-based**: SIGs strive for consensus in decision-making.
2. **Ownership**: When consensus cannot be reached, final decisions are left at the discretion of SIG owner.
3. **Transparency**: All significant decisions are documented and shared with the broader community.

### Deliverables

1. **Proposals**: SIGs develop and refine proposals for new features or significant changes.
2. **Documentation**: SIGs are responsible for maintaining documentation related to their focus area.

### Reporting

1. **Regular Updates**: SIGs provide updates to the broader Semaphore community on their progress and plans.
2. **Annual Review**: Each SIG conducts an annual review of its activities, achievements, and future goals.

### Community Engagement

1. **Open Participation**: SIG meetings and discussions are open to all interested parties.
2. **Mentorship**: Experienced SIG members often mentor newcomers to help them contribute effectively.
3. **Cross-SIG Collaboration**: SIGs collaborate with each other on overlapping or interdependent initiatives.

By operating in this structured yet flexible manner, SIGs can effectively drive progress in their focus areas while ensuring community involvement and transparency. This approach allows Semaphore to benefit from diverse perspectives and expertise, leading to better outcomes as a whole.

## Joining a SIG

Joining a Special Interest Group is a great way to contribute to Semaphore and collaborate with others who share your interests. Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Choose a SIG**: 
   - Review the list of current SIGs in the [Current SIGs](#current-sigs) section above.
   - Select a SIG that aligns with your interests or expertise.

2. **Join the Communication Channels**:
   - Join the SIG's Discord channel (listed in the SIG's space).

3. **Attend a Meeting**:
   - Check the SIG's calendar for upcoming meetings (found in the SIG's space).
   - Attend a meeting as an observer to get a feel for the group's dynamics and current projects.
   - Introduce yourself during the meeting when appropriate.

4. **Review Current Work**:
   - Look at the SIG's **Ongoing** section to understand ongoing work.
   - Read through recent meeting minutes to catch up on discussions and decisions.

5. **Start Contributing**:
   - Participate in discussions on Discord or GitHub.
   - Offer to help with documentation, code reviews, or testing.

6. **Engage Regularly**:
   - Attend meetings consistently to stay involved in discussions and decision-making.
   - Contribute your ideas and feedback on ongoing projects.

Remember, you're welcome to join multiple SIGs if you're interested in various aspects of Semaphore. Each SIG may have slightly different norms and processes, so don't hesitate to ask questions and seek guidance from more experienced members.

If you're new to Semaphore, joining a SIG is an excellent way to learn and grow while making meaningful contributions. Welcome aboard!
