# SIG - API and extensibility

**SIG Maintainer:** [@radwo](https://github.com/radwo)
 
The API and Extensibility Special Interest Group is dedicated to improving and expanding Semaphore's API capabilities and its integration ecosystem. This SIG plays a crucial role in ensuring that Semaphore remains flexible, powerful, and developer-friendly.

**Key Focus Areas:**

1. **API Development:** Enhancing and maintaining Semaphore's API to support a wide range of use cases.
2. **Extensibility:** Developing and improving integrations with other tools and platforms.
3. **Developer Experience:** Ensuring the API and integrations are intuitive and well-documented.

**Goals:**

- Source feedback from the community and users on API and integration needs.
- Align API and extensibility development with real-world developer requirements.
- Improve documentation and resources for API users and integration developers.
- Identify and prioritize new integration opportunities.

We welcome contributions from API enthusiasts, integration specialists, and anyone interested in improving how Semaphore connects with other tools in the development pipeline.
